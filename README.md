# Sentiment Analysis on Uber and Ola 🚖📊

This project analyzes public sentiment around Uber and Ola services using Twitter data. It leverages deep learning models like CNNs and MLPs to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiment. A Flask-based web interface allows users to interact with the trained model and make predictions.

## 🧠 Overview

- **Data**: 3000 tweets about Uber and Ola (CSV format)
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Word2Vec, SQLite
- **Models Used**: 
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
  - Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **UI**: Basic user registration, login, and input-based sentiment prediction

## 🗂️ Project Structure

```bash
📁 model.ipynb        # Jupyter Notebook with model training and visualizations
📁 app.py             # Flask web app backend
📁 model.pkl          # Trained ML model
📁 cv.pkl             # CountVectorizer/TF-IDF model
📁 signup.db          # SQLite database for login/signup
📁 Uber_3000.csv      # Dataset: Tweets about Uber
📁 Ola_3000.csv       # Dataset: Tweets about Ola
```

## ⚙️ Features

- Tweet preprocessing (removal of stop words, hyperlinks, etc.)
- Sentiment classification using deep learning
- Flask-based web app with:
  - User signup/login
  - Input field for tweet text
  - Real-time prediction
- Cleaned and stored models (`model.pkl`, `cv.pkl`) for reuse

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Flask app
python app.py
```

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Expand to multi-class sentiment (e.g., neutral, sarcastic)
- Use pre-trained transformer models like BERT
- Enhance UI with modern frontend frameworks (React, Vue)
- Integrate live Twitter scraping with Tweepy
